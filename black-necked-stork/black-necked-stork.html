    <h2>Black Necked Stork</h2>
    <br><br>
    <div>The black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) is a tall long-necked wading bird in the stork family. It is a resident species across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia with a disjunct population in Australia. It lives in wetland habitats and near fields of certain crops such as rice and wheat where it forages for a wide range of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and irridescent blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris with females sporting yellow irises and males having dark-coloured irises. In Australia, it is sometimes called a jabiru although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that is strongly territorial when feeding and breeding.<br><br>Black Necked Stork are found in Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary. Other birds such as Cattle Egret, Rose Ringed Parakeet, etc are also seen in Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary.</div>
